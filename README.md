# smart-gamble
blockchain gambling: proof of concept

## How to run
There are enough tools to compile test and debug smart contracts.
The fastest way to test smart contracts is using [online](https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/) solidity compiler by [Ethereum Project](https://www.ethereum.org/).
Another way is to use command line interface with the Etherium-oriented browser. According to this approach, you may need [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth/) for running an ethereum node on your local machine and [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist) to browse and use Applications with smart contracts (DAPPs)
